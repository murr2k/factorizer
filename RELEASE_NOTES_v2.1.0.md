## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
./factorizer_v2.1 1234567890123456789
```

### With Montgomery Reduction (automatic for odd numbers)
```bash
./factorizer_v2.1 --algorithm brent 9999999900000001
```

### Benchmark Mode
```bash
./factorizer_v2.1 --benchmark
```

### Custom Configuration
```bash
./factorizer_v2.1 --algorithm brent --grid 64x256 --iterations 10000000 <number>
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed carry propagation issues in 128-bit multiplication
- Resolved CUDA detection problems in WSL2
- Corrected memory alignment for texture operations
- Fixed race conditions in factor storage

## 📋 Known Limitations
- Numbers beyond 40 digits still require advanced algorithms (Quadratic Sieve, GNFS)
- Montgomery reduction only works with odd moduli
- NVML features require NVIDIA driver 418.30 or newer
- Progress monitoring adds ~5% overhead

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From v2.0.0
1. No API changes - drop-in replacement
2. Recompile with new Makefile for optimal performance
3. Consider enabling progress monitoring for long factorizations

### New Features Opt-in
- Progress monitoring: Enabled by default, disable with `--no-progress`
- GPU monitoring: Requires NVML, disable if not available
- Algorithm selection: Automatic by default, override with `--algorithm`

## 🔮 Future Development

Next release (v2.2.0) will focus on:
- Quadratic Sieve implementation for 20-40 digit numbers
- Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) for medium factors
- Multi-GPU support
- REST API service
