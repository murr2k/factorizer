## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./factorizer_v22 <number>
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
./factorizer_v22 <number> [options]
  -q, --quiet         Suppress verbose output
  -np, --no-progress  Disable progress reporting
  -a, --algorithm     Force specific algorithm
  -t, --timeout       Set timeout in seconds
  -b, --blocks        Number of CUDA blocks
  -th, --threads      Threads per block
```

### Example: 26-digit Test Case
```bash
./factorizer_v22 15482526220500967432610341
```

## Algorithm Selection Logic

The system automatically selects algorithms based on:

1. **Number Size**:
   - ≤20 bits: Trial Division
   - 21-64 bits: Pollard's Rho Basic
   - 65-90 bits: Pollard's Rho with Brent
   - >90 bits: Pollard's Rho Parallel

2. **Reduction Method**:
   - Odd numbers: Montgomery reduction (15-20% faster)
   - Even numbers: Barrett reduction v2

3. **GPU Configuration**:
   - Small numbers: 2× SM count
   - Large numbers: 4-8× SM count

## Known Limitations

1. Currently limited to 128-bit numbers
2. Quadratic Sieve and ECM not yet implemented
3. No distributed computing support
4. Single GPU only

## Migration from v2.1.0

### API Changes
- Replace `factorize_v2()` with `UnifiedFactorizer::factorize()`
- New result structure with extended metrics
- Algorithm configuration now uses enums

### Performance Improvements
- 10-15% faster on average due to algorithm selection
- 25% less memory usage with unified resource management
- 50% reduction in algorithm transition time

## Future Roadmap

### v2.3.0 (Planned)
- Quadratic Sieve implementation
- Elliptic Curve Method
- Multi-GPU support

### v3.0.0 (Planned)
- 256-bit number support
