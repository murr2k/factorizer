## Performance Analysis

### Success Rate by Number Size
- **≤16 digits**: 100% success rate
- **25 digits**: 0% (timeout)
- **31-45 digits**: Found only small composite factors

### Speed Improvements vs Original
- **11-digit**: >8x faster (from >30s timeout to 3.8s)
- **12-digit**: Successfully factored (previously timed out)
- **13-digit**: Successfully factored (previously timed out)
- **16-digit**: Successfully factored in 11.1s

### Algorithm Behavior
1. **Small-Medium Numbers (≤16 digits)**: Pollard's Rho effectively finds all prime factors
2. **Large Numbers (25+ digits)**: 
   - Algorithm struggles with large prime factors
   - Only finds small factors when number is composite
   - Requires more advanced algorithms (Quadratic Sieve, GNFS)

## Technical Observations

### Strengths
1. **Corrected uint128_t arithmetic** enables proper handling of large numbers
2. **Parallel execution** with multiple CUDA threads improves performance
3. **GCD algorithm** efficiently identifies factors
4. **Verification** confirms correctness of found factors

### Limitations
1. **Simple modular arithmetic** (not full Barrett reduction) limits speed on very large numbers
2. **Pollard's Rho** has theoretical limits for large semiprimes
3. **Memory constraints** with MAX_FACTORS limit
4. **No algorithm switching** based on number characteristics

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Implement full Barrett/Montgomery reduction** for faster modular arithmetic
2. **Add Quadratic Sieve** for 20-40 digit numbers
3. **Implement GNFS** for 40+ digit numbers
4. **Add intelligent algorithm selection** based on input size

### For Current Implementation
- Excellent for factoring numbers up to 16 digits
- Suitable for finding small factors of larger composites
- Not suitable for large semiprimes (25+ digits)

## Conclusion

The improved 128-bit factorizer represents a significant advancement over the original implementation, successfully factoring all test cases up to 16 digits with good performance. The hive-mind improvements to uint128_t arithmetic and parallel Pollard's Rho algorithm have proven effective within the algorithm's theoretical limits.

For numbers beyond 20 digits, more advanced factorization algorithms would be required to achieve practical factorization times.
